Git
===

All of the DHIL projects use Git for version control.

Installation
------------

Mac OS X provides a ``git`` command as part of the XCode suite. It is usually
out of date, so it's best to install Git from Homebrew.

.. code-block:: console

  $ brew install git
  $ git --version
  git version 2.18.0

Global Configuration
--------------------

You can define a default global git configuration in your home direction. Each
project managed by git can override any of the configuration options. Open
``$HOME/.gitconfig`` and add some lines like this:

.. code-block:: ini

  [user]
        name = BOB TERWILLIGER
        email = bob@springfield.com

  [core]
        excludesfile = ~/.gitignore_global
        editor=/usr/bin/atom

  [github]
        user = BOBTER

These settings will add your name and email address to commits, and will ignore
any file pattern found in $HOME/.gitignore_global. It will also configure a
default Github username for any interactions with Github.

You can now edit ``$HOME/.gitignore_global`` to make sure git ignores some files.

.. code-block:: ini

  *~
  *.log

This setup will ignore any file that ends in a tilde (~) and any log file.

Encryption Keys
---------------

Command line git is easiest to use when you've set up ssh keys. They enable
secure password-less communication between computers.

.. sidebar:: Existing Keys

  You might already have a public/private key pair. Check for them like so::

  $ ls ~/.ssh/

  If the output includes a file called ``id_rsa.pub`` you can skip this step.

Start by generating a public/private key pair. The command below will ask some
questions. Press enter to accept the defaults. There will be a lot of output, so
only the important lines are shown below.

.. code-block:: console

  $ ssh-keygen
  Generating public/private rsa key pair.
  Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/USERNAME/.ssh/id_rsa):
  Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
  Enter same passphrase again:
  Your identification has been saved in /Users/USERNAME/.ssh/id_rsa.
  Your public key has been saved in /Users/USERNAME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

  (lots of output cut)

  $ ls ~/.ssh/
  id_rsa          id_rsa.pub

Success. From this point forward, git will attempt to use the ssh keys generated
above to interact with servers.

Create a Github Account
-----------------------

We use `GitHub`_ to manage most of our souce code. Visit the website, sign up,
and we will add you as a contributor to the `SFU DHIL account`_.

.. sidebar:: Hidden Files and Directories

  File and directory names that start with a dot(.) are hidden. The OS X Finder
  won't show you these directories by default. One example is the ``.ssh``
  directory inside your home directory. You can open that directory in the
  finder: ``open ~/.ssh`` to see the contents.

Once you've signed up for an account you should add your SSH public key. It
lives in ``/Users/USERNAME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub``. That's inside a hidden directory.
To open it, return to the command line.

.. note::

  In the next example, the public key file is named ``id_rsa.pub``. It is
  perfectly safe to distribute this key to the world. There's also a file in
  the directory called ``id_rsa`` (note the missing ``.pub`` suffix). This file
  must be kept private and confidential.

.. code-block:: console

  $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDf/SMEHG3tLUDDVwbBAlZNJTrS24enBBwV
  dfkuTXDRBtSaeCt0ImuQfi6hNE9Kl0W6E0rnbu3itM7uqnNF3AcexHKHwUawjFPCRmEO8Dx+
  tOmQX0cbMUeCuMcV7wRMmCSjRY9p781X1wqGw6pYA4DeuFqtTzctmOsXMqsZig28USNYvXIc
  VkevWoJzZn4ftfMbnkkrGR6B7H4D8z3Pw98MisM4M2jN8/8GbTHFSKawNmY2Guy+hT9ndinX
  Rs0I5thvpDqLsVS1z1+9NGmJgM5x/LTyOjgO0DwNx5q/uU2BmImu8MQEA9qe5sZ0bddtpiL6
  xh5LyRJpv1RB+Yyc6x3b USERNAME@COMPUTERNAME

Open your `Github Profile`_ page, navigate to the SSH & GPG keys section. Copy
and paste the contents of the key (from ``ssh-rsa`` to ``USERNAME@COMPUTERNAME``)
into the box, and give the key a name.

You can have multiple public keys registered in GitHub, but this is really only
useful if you have multiple computers.

Using Git and Github
--------------------

Many of the projects use a bunch of similar functionality. Rather than
recreating very similar code in each project it is grouped together into
git submodules. That way each project can share the functionality and bug fixes
quite easily.

We prefer smaller commits that contain a completed feature or fix a bug
to larger commits that address many different concerns. Smaller commits are
easier to read and review, and finding the source of a problem is easier if
the commits are smaller.

Once git and github are configured, the :ref:`section-apps` documentation should
help you get an app set up. But to quickly summarize:

.. note::

  So far we haven't been working in git branches in the DHIL, but we really
  should. The documentation below assumes you are working in the default branch.

#. Create a fork of a project in GitHub.

#. Clone your fork to your computer, and work in the fork.

    .. code-block:: console

      $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:USERNAME/PROJECT.git
      (useless output goes here)
      $ cd PROJECT

#. Add the upstream repository to your git repository. This will let you keep
   your fork up to date with the DHIL repository.

    .. code-block:: console

      $ git remote add upstream http://github.com/sfu-dhil/PROJECT.git

#. Do all of the configuration steps to get the project working.

#. Edit the source code. Don't forget to write tests.

#. Check on the status of your files.

    .. code-block:: console

      $ git status
      On branch master
      Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

      Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

      modified:   bower.json

      no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

#. Make some commits in the fork.

    .. code-block:: console

      $ git commit -m "Update the bower metadata." bower.json
      [master 1791385] Update the bower metadata.
      1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)

#. Push your commits into your github fork.

    .. code-block:: console

      $ git push
      (lots of useless output omitted)
      To github.com:ubermichael/ceww.git
      c1b3cb3..1791385  master -> master

#. Create a pull request. Open your fork of the project in Github and there
   should be a "Pull Request" button.

   It's a good idea to tag someone in the DHIL in the pull request by requesting
   a review.

#. Once your pull request is accepted you should update your repository.

    .. code-block:: console

      $ git pull upstream master
      (more useless output)

Alternatives to the Command Line
--------------------------------

`SourceTree`_ is a fine alternative to using the command line. It will show
commit history, create commits and branches, push them to different repositories
and does all sorts of other nice things.

`GitHub Desktop`_ is also a good client, but one that is very specific to
GitHub. It offers many of the same features as SourceTree but isn't quite as
polished.
