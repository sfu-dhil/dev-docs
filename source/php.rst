PHP
===

Mac OS X includes a version of PHP which is often out of date. Luckily Homebrew
makes installing another PHP very easy.

Installation
------------

The DHIL production server runs PHP 5.6, so we will install that. installing
other versions of PHP is possible and quite easy. See below for more information.

.. code-block:: console
  :linenos:

  $ brew install php pkg-config imagemagick composer
  $ pecl install imagick

Line 1 installs PHP and friends. The install command will print
a lot of information to the terminal which you can mostly ignore.

Line 2 installs the PHP extension that uses imagemagick. It uses PHP's package
manager to download and configure it. The command will ask for a path to the
imagemagick library. Press enter to accept the default (autodetect) which
should find the library.

Configuring
-----------

The pecl install step (line 4 above) will automatically configure PHP to find
the imagick extension. Other configuration options are available in
``/usr/local/etc/php/7.2/php.ini``

You must set the timezone in the ``php.ini`` file. Open the file in your text
editor, and find the ``[Date]`` section.

.. code-block:: ini
  :linenos:

  [Date]
  ; Defines the default timezone used by the date functions
  ; http://php.net/date.timezone
  ;date.timezone =

Uncomment line 4 by removing the semicolon at the start of the line, then add
"America/Vancouver" to the end. The result should be

.. code-block:: ini
  :linenos:

  [Date]
  ; Defines the default timezone used by the date functions
  ; http://php.net/date.timezone
  date.timezone = America/Vancouver

Other recommended settings are:

 * ``memory_limit = 128M`` Change this to 256M or higher.

 * ``html_errors = On`` Change this to Off.

 * ``post_max_size = 8M`` Change this to 64M or higher.

 * ``upload_max_filesize = 2M`` Change this to 60M or higher. It should be less than
   the value of ``post_max_size``.

Test PHP
--------

PHP includes a few command line tools. These sample commands should all work and
print useful things. If you try these commands and get an error message, something
has gone wrong in the installation.

.. code-block:: console

  $ php --version
  PHP 7.2.6 (cli) (built: Jun 22 2018 00:08:38)
  (and less useful output)

  [14:02:03][michael@sophie devenv]$ php -m
  [PHP Modules]
  bcmath
  bz2
  calendar
  Core
  (and many many more)
