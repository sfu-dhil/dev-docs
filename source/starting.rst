Getting Started
===============

This guide assumes you are setting up a development environment for use in the
Digital Humanities Innovation Lab on a Mac. There are many comparable systems
for using Windows or Linux, but we don't have any users on those systems to
test out the documentation. If you'd like to use those systems and write
documentation on your experiences, please do.

Contributions via our `Github`_ are always welcome.

Conventions
-----------

.. sidebar:: More information

  Some pages will contain additional information in a sidebar like this.

File paths are typeset in a ``monotype`` font in running text to distinguish
them from the surrounding content.

Terminal commands may be referred to inline like ``cat /path/to/file`` for a
simple description. Longer commands or commands with output are typeset as in
the next example.

.. code-block:: console
  :linenos:

  $ ruby --version
  ruby 2.0.0p648 (2015-12-16 revision 53162) [universal.x86_64-darwin15]

Line 1 above has the command that should be typed, prefixed by a dollar sign.
Don't type the dollar sign as part of the command.

Line 2 has the output from the command. It isn't prefixed with a dollar sign to
indicate that it is output.

.. note::

  Warnings, notes, and other important information will be included in notes
  like this one.

.. todo::

  Some parts of the documentation are not as complete or edited as they should
  be. Those parts have been noted in these *todo* blocks.

Command line
------------

Many of the tools used in this guide are installed, configured, and run from
the command line. You should have a basic familiarity with the running commands
from the terminal.

There are plenty of resources on the Internet to help a person learn to use
the command line and the terminal.

.. note::

  OS X includes a usable terminal/command line program at
  ``/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app``. It's good enough for most purposes. If
  you'd like to use something more sophisticated, iTerm2_ is a very powerful
  replacement.

Tools
-----

All the tools described by this guide have a common dependency. They will not
work without Apple's XCode tools installed. You don't need the full, complete
XCode suite, just the command line tools. Like everything else, there's a
command to do that.

.. code-block:: console

  $ xcode-select --install

XCode is a big piece of software. Expect it to take a long time to download.

.. todo::

  Why is xcode needed to run all the tools? Is this something that could be explained
  or linked out to another resource? Is it important or necessary to update xcode based
  on which version of OSX you are running? If it is important, I found instruction on
  how to update xcode command line tools here:
