Offboarding
===========

This page contains instructions on how to remove the Digital Humanities Innovation Lab's
developing environment from your computer. The current instructions are only for Mac computers.
Tools are presented in the order they should be removed.

All of the DHIL applications are Open Source. You can take them with you if you'd
like. Removing them and the development environment is optional.

Sphinx and Python
-----------------

As python and Sphinx are installed using Homebrew, if you remove all Homebrew packages and uninstall
Homebrew, python and Sphinx will also be uninstalled. However, if you wish to keep Homebrew and only
remove python and Sphinx, you can do so using the following command

Sphinx is a python package. If you wish you keep Homebrew and the Homebrew installation of
Python but remove Sphinx, you can do so using python's package manager.

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip3 uninstall Sphinx

This will remove Sphinx but will not affect Homebrew or your Homebrew installation of python.

.. code-block:: console

  $ brew uninstall python --force

``--force`` is required to ensure all Homebrew versions of python are uninstalled. Otherwise,
Homebrew will continue to install the latest version of python (or any package) that it knows
about when you update all packages using ``brew upgrade``.


MySQL
-----

MySQL runs as a background service. You must stop the background service before
removing it.

.. code-block:: console
  :linenos:

  $ brew services stop mysql@5.7
  $ brew uninstall --force mysql@5.7
  $ rm -rf /usr/local/var/mysql

Line 1 stops the MySQL process and unloads it from memory. Line 2 removes the
MySQL server files, but does not remove any of the MySQL data files. Line 3
clears out all of the MySQL database files.

PHP
---

The set-up guide for PHP includes the PHP installation as well as the installation of a number of
PHP extensions. PHP and the extensions (pkg_config, imagemagick, and composer) can be uninstalled
using Hombrew. To remove all four packages, run

.. code-block:: console

  $ brew uninstall php@5.6 pkg_config imagemagick composer --force

This will also remove all configuration files edited when installing :ref:`section-php`.

Node and Node Tools
-------------------

If you've followed this guide, NodeJS is just another Homebrew package, and
can be removed like all the rest. This will also uninstall the Node Package
Manager (npm).

.. code-block:: console

  $ brew uninstall node

This command won't touch any of the Symfony applications you've downloaded to
your computer, and that's probably a good thing.

Apache
------

Apache was installed using Homebrew so you can use Homebrew to remove it. The command is

.. code-block:: console

  $ brew services stop httpd
  $ brew uninstall httpd --force

This will also remove all configuration files edited when installing :ref:`section-apache`.

Git
---

Git was installed using Homebrew so you can use Homebrew to remove it. The command is

.. code-block:: console

  $ brew uninstall git --force


DHIL Symfony Apps
-----------------

If you have been following this guide, all Symfony apps will be held within the
``~/Sites`` directory. To uninstall the app from your computer you will need to:

  - Delete the app from the ``~/Sites`` directory
  - Remove the database and user from MySQL.

To remove the app from the command line, enter the following command where ``app_name``
is the name of the app directory.

.. code-block:: console

  $ rm -rf ~/Sites/app_name

If you are completely removing MySQL, you will not need delete individual databases as
they will be removed when MySQL is deleted. If you would like to remove the databse for
a single app, complete the following steps.

Xcode Command Line Tools
------------------------

If you installed the XCode command line tools following the instructions in this guide, you can
uninstall it by removing the ``/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`` directory. The command looks like

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools

You will need to run this command using sudo, which will prompt you for your administrator password.

Homebrew
--------

You can uninstall Homebrew using the uninstall command that is printed on the `Homebrew FAQs`_ page.
It looks like

.. code-block:: console

  $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)"

That command will attempt to uninstall and remove all homebrew pacakages. If it does not completely
remove all packages, you may need to run the command using sudo, which will prompt you for your
administrator password.
