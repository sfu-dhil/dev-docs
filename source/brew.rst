Homebrew
========

Homebrew_ is a package manager for OS X. The Homebrew project collects and
distributes open-source packages aimed at developers. All interaction with
Homebrew is via the command line.

.. sidebar:: Hidden Directories

  ``/usr/local`` and ``/var`` are hidden directories in OS X. They're available
  from the command line and can be made visible in the Finder, but this isn't
  usually necessary.

All the Homebrew packages install under ``/usr/local`` and are configured to
work in that directory as well. For example, MySQL would normally store its
data files in ``/var/mysql/data`` but Homebrew's MySQL will store data in
``/usr/local/var/mysql``.

If your Homebrew environment ever becomes corrupted you can remove the entire
``/usr/local`` directory and start again. Homebrew does not mess with the OS X
system applications at all.

Installation
------------

The install command is printed on the Homebrew_ home page, and can be
copy/pasted directly into the terminal. It looks like

.. code-block:: console

  /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

That one command will download the Homebrew system and put it in the right place.
It may ask for your administrator password, and that's OK.

Usage
-----

Once it's installed, Homebrew provides the ``brew`` command which is the primary
way to interact with the package manager. For example, to see a list of all the
installed packages use ``brew list``::

  $ brew list
  ant		freetds		libidn2		ncftp		saxon
  (and many many more)

This list will be empty if you haven't installed any commands yet.

Brew provides more commands. You can get a list of them via ``brew help`` or
from the `Homebrew documentation`_.

  for using it.
